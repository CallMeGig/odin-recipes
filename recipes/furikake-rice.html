        <p>Although it is only made of rice, scrambled eggs, chicken, and green onions,
            this dish relies on a secret ingredient to make it special: gelatin cubes.</p>

        <p>This recipe is a tad difficult if you have little cooking experience, but it
            gets easier after you've prepared the chicken broth.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp of sesame oil</li>
            <li>7-8 chicken wings</li>
            <li>2 tsp of bonito or fish soup stock</li>
            <li>5-6 cups of water for the broth, and ½ cup of water for the gelatin</li>
            <li>2 tsp of grated ginger</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of sugar</li>
            <li>3 tbsp of light soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of sake</li>

            <li>1 cup of white rice</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Serves 1-2</p>
